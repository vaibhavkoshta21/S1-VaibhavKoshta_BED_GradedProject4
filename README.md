An Employee Management Rest Api based Web application is created, where we will be developing CRUD(Create,Read,Update and Delete) functionality along with Sorting and some concepts of security.

The Rest Api is secured and should have different endpoints for different operations-

1. The application is able to add roles in the database dynamically in the db.

2. The application is able to add Users in the db which can be used for authentication purposes.

3. The application is able to add employees data in the db if and only if the authenticated user is ADMIN-

4. The application is able to provide an endpoint to list all the employees stored in the database.

5. The application is able to provide endpoint to fetch or get an employee record specifically based on the id of that employee-

6. The application is able to provide an endpoint to update an existing employee record with the given updated json object.

7. The application is able to provide an endpoint to delete an existing employee record based on the id of the employee-

8. The application is able to provide an endpoint to fetch an employee by his/her first name and if found more than one record then list them all-

9. The application is able to list all employee records sorted on their first name in either ascending order or descending order .
